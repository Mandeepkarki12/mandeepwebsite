                <h1>Roronoa Zoro</h1>
                <h5>Swordman</h5>
                <p> Roronoa Zoro,[1] also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro,[7] is the combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates,
                    and one of their two swordsmen. Formerly a bounty hunter,[5] he is the second member of Luffy's crew
                    and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.[3]

                    As a master of Santoryu, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in
                    Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is among the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside
                    Luffy and Sanji.[19][20] His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to
                    honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.[21]

                    In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, Zoro is also
                    regarded as one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "Worst Generation".[22]

                    He currently has a bounty of Beli.png320,000,000.[16]</p>
